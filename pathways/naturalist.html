        <h1>Naturalist</h1>
        <div class="tagline">Loving God Out of Doors</div>

        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <p>We find God in His "cathedral" - the out-of-doors.</p>

        <p>God's first dwelling with us was in a garden (Genesis 2). God will speak to us through creation. Consider our spiritual lessons learned in observing the metamorphosis a caterpillar encounters in becoming a butterfly.</p>

        <p><em>"The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the works of his hands."</em> Psalm 19:1</p>

        <p><em>"For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities are clearly seen, being understood from what has been made."</em> Romans 1:20</p>

        <p>More than God's beauty is revealed outside. His awful and fearful terror is revealed as well, i.e. rain can nourish the ground and can flood a region. Creation teaches us of God's beauty and also of His power and judgment.</p>

        <p>David says that God's green pastures and quiet waters restore his soul (Psalm 23:2-3). Jesus sought lonely places to pray and be replenished. He taught his disciples to do the same.</p>

        <h2>What Are Our Pitfalls?</h2>

        <p><strong>INDIVIDUALISM:</strong> Jesus spent time outdoors to prepare to go back into the world. We must make sure we are not using creation to escape the duties of following Jesus.</p>

        <p><strong>SPIRITUAL DELUSION:</strong> Anything "received" on a walk with God should not be considered authoritative, but merely advice that must be tested. The Bible is our only sure guide. Satan can provide counterfeit experiences that can lead us astray.</p>

        <p><strong>IDOLIZING NATURE:</strong> Be wary of the heresy of pantheism – the worship of nature. It is not true that God is in all of nature, or that nature is God. The Bible teaches, "the earth is the Lord's." Pantheism twists it to "The earth is the Lord." Pantheism is a New Age philosophy. Nevertheless, do not allow the lie of pantheism rob you of worshiping God through an appreciation of what he has made.</p>

        <h2>Suggestions for the Road</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Fully commit your life to Christ. The more you appreciate the Creator, the more you will appreciate His creation.</li>
            <li>Consider the greatness of creation – mountains, sky, and oceans all portray the immense power, wisdom and goodness of God.</li>
            <li>Consider the variety of creation – plant and animal life have more variety than we could ever examine in a lifetime. God is capable of doing a multitude of things at once.</li>
            <li>Consider the beauty of creation – beauty in God's world comes a many shapes, colors, shades. God's beauty cannot be revealed through one form.</li>
            <li>Consider the abundance of creation - count stars in sky, sand on shore, trees in forest. We serve a God of plenty whose love and mercy are inexhaustible.</li>
            <li>View God's world as His cathedral where He wants to meet with you and others.</li>
        </ul>
