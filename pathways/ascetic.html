        <h1>Ascetic</h1>
        <div class="tagline">Loving God in Solitude and Simplicity</div>

        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The ascetic temperament gravitates toward solitude, austerity, simplicity, and deep commitment. It represents believers who are not afraid of discipline, severity, and solitude. It is similar to the monastic lifestyle. Austere can mean morally strict, somber, grave, unadorned or simple.</li>
            <li>Most of our solitude is forced, not chosen, creating loneliness rather than spiritual intimacy with the Father.</li>
            <li>Ascetics, perhaps more than any of the other temperaments, must practice loving God.</li>
            <li>A Nazirite vow was taken by people for a period of time during which they abstained from alcohol, refrained from cutting their hair, and had no contact with a dead body. During a Nazirite vow these people were "set apart" for a special purpose. The vow was for a set period of time, then they could leave their solitude to fulfill the social obligations of their faith.</li>
            <li>John the Baptist lived a solitary and ascetic life.</li>
            <li>Jesus fasted for 40 days in solitude, and had moments of solitude during ministry (Mark 1:35; Matthew 26:36).</li>
            <li>Jesus taught prayer should be done in secret.</li>
            <li>Anyone who has been stretched in ministry knows that Jesus' real battle over facing the cross was fought in Gethsemane. He finally won by choosing to be obedient.</li>
            <li>The devout are called to mourn, see: Lamentations, Daniel & Joel.</li>
            <li>Naturalists might go to a beautiful countryside; an Ascetic may seek a barren wasteland.</li>
            <li>While sensate Christians are often drawn to God through their senses, ascetic Christians are often distracted by their senses so they will try to shut them out.</li>
            <li>Christian asceticism doesn't seek suffering or self-denial as an end, but as a means, as a way to love "something else that God might be loved more."</li>
            <li>Ascetics stress deeds before words.</li>
            <li>True ascetics are strict with themselves but treat others with supernatural gentleness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Are Our Pitfalls?</h2>

        <p><strong>OVEREMPHASIZING PERSONAL PIETY:</strong> Instead of outward displays of piety, God calls people to administer true justice by showing mercy and compassion. "Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the alien or the poor" Zechariah 7:1-10. Our need for spiritual refreshment must be balanced with our obligation to reach out to others.</p>

        <p><strong>SEEKING PAIN FOR ITS OWN SAKE:</strong> Masochism is a sickness, not a spiritual path. Asceticism is a means to an end, never an end in itself.</p>

        <p><strong>SEEKING TO GAIN GOD'S FAVOR:</strong> It is futile to try to win God's approval or forgiveness by developing an extraordinary holiness. There is nothing we can do that can make God love us any more. His love is absolute and His forgiveness is based on a prior work completed by Jesus, not our current spiritual practices.</p>

        <h2>Suggestions for the Road</h2>

        <p><strong>SOLITUDE:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perhaps create a prayer room in your home.</li>
            <li>See if your church will give you keys to the sanctuary to get away and pray.</li>
            <li>Learn to live in detachment within society.</li>
            <li>Arrive early to work or class to be alone.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>AUSTERITY:</strong> Be very simple. Susanna Wesley frequently pulled her apron over her head and prayed. Her kids learned not to bother her during that time.</p>

        <p><strong>STRICTNESS:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ascetics are strict only because they want to reserve their time and energy to passionately pursue God.</li>
            <li>Fast. Deny yourself some pleasure, entertainment, or comfort, and then focus on purity of mind and heart. You can fast from food entirely, just eat one light meal per day, or fast certain types of food.</li>
            <li>Some Christians have found the middle of the night to be one of their best times of prayer & worship.</li>
            <li>Rise earlier than normal one day per week.</li>
            <li>More important than losing sleep is being vigilant when others commonly are not.</li>
            <li>Try to be silent for a few hours at a time.</li>
            <li>Take a personal retreat for several hours, an afternoon, a day, weekend or a week at a time.</li>
            <li>Endure hardship rather than fight it; don't choose to be pampered. Don't demand to be warm when it is cold.</li>
            <li>When sickness, heat, cold, hunger, or tiredness come, you can either adopt a demanding spirit and stunt your spiritual growth, or embrace them, learn from them, and mature in you faith. Your attitude will make all the difference.</li>
        </ul>
