        <h1>Enthusiast</h1>
        <div class="tagline">Loving God with Mystery and Celebration</div>

        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Enthusiasts enjoy celebratory worship as well as many of the more supernatural forms of faith.</li>
            <li>People with this spiritual temperament like to let go and experience God on the precipice of excitement and awe.</li>
            <li>We worship and serve a supernatural God who manifests himself to us in supernatural ways.</li>
            <li>In a cynical and depressed world, enthusiasts point toward faith, mystery, and expectancy. When the situation seems impossible, enthusiasts say, "Now God's really going to move!"</li>
            <li>It is a sinful tendency to lapse into a practical "atheism," believing in God, but not expecting him to move in supernatural ways.</li>
            <li>Sometimes we may be using a gift God has given us and say something that sounds profound and then think, "Where in the world did that come from?"</li>
            <li>Sometimes a prayer is answered in a way that makes coincidence seem impossible.</li>
            <li>Celebration has a wide background in Scripture.</li>
            <li>A person's reluctance to celebrate enthusiastically is more a personal foible than a sign of maturity.</li>
            <li>Remember, celebratory worship must still include reverence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Are Our Pitfalls?</h2>

        <p><strong>SEEKING EXPERIENCES FOR EXPERIENCES' SAKE:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Beware – many spiritual manifestations are expressly forbidden for a Christian, see Deuteronomy 18:10-12.</li>
            <li>Be careful to remain true to seeking God rather than searching for new experiences.</li>
            <li>To demand that God answer all our prayers with a "yes" is to ask for his omnipotence [power] without having the benefit of his omniscience [knowledge].</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>BEING INDEPENDENT:</strong> Enthusiasts need to be rooted in a strong church to help them interpret their encounters with God.</p>

        <p><strong>EQUATING "GOOD FEELINGS" WITH "GOOD WORSHIP":</strong> Feelings come and go. Enthusiasts shouldn't apologize for enjoying them, but they should avoid becoming dependent upon them.</p>

        <h2>Suggestions for the Road</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>For some who have lost their ability to celebrate, spending time with children might be a good way to recapture the joy and wonder of your faith.</li>
            <li>You should never accept a dream that clashes with the revelation of Scripture. Also, never make a major decision based solely on a dream. However, you may find that God can bring insight into a situation, or give you a warning, when you are open to receiving something in a dream.</li>
            <li>Expect God to give you specific answers to specific prayers.</li>
            <li>Believe God to heal or respond in a supernatural way in real situations in your life.</li>
            <li>Step out in faith. Whether it's building a business, writing a poem, planting a garden, painting a picture, creating something can be a profoundly holy experience.</li>
        </ul>
