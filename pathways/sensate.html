        <h1>Sensate</h1>
        <div class="tagline">Loving God with the Senses</div>

        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Some Christians are moved by sensuous worship more than anything else.</li>
            <li>By sensuous we're referring to the five senses of taste, touch, smell, sound, and sight.</li>
            <li>When we reduce worship to intellectual assent, we are forced to worship God in crippled existence.</li>
            <li>Ezekiel feels a wind, sees flashing lightning, hears the sound of wings, and is asked to eat a scroll that tastes sweet. After all this he sits down, stunned for 7 days (Ezekiel 1, 3).</li>
            <li>John is overwhelmed by loud trumpet voices, blazing eyes, and sounds of rushing waters as he writes to the 7 churches of Revelation.</li>
            <li>Sometimes experiencing God comes with overwhelming stimulation.</li>
            <li>This is a flashing glimpse of heaven.</li>
            <li>Christianity without beauty becomes a disembodied religion of the mind.</li>
            <li>Using our bodies to glorify God is a much better response than denying the role of the body in worship, and then turning around and using the body in areas that lead to sin.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Are Our Pitfalls?</h2>

        <p><strong>WORSHIPING WITHOUT CONVICTION OR CONTENT:</strong> Words by be sung with no more emotion than placing an order for a Big Mac. Also, while we're singing, the words we say don't really matter. God knows it's just a song, we think. Music can make us feign a commitment that just isn't there, causing us to become callous, insincere believers.</p>

        <p><strong>IDOLIZING BEAUTY:</strong> Someone could leave a very beautiful liturgical service satisfied by the sensuous experience without having entered the true presence of God.</p>

        <p><strong>WORSHIPING WORSHIP:</strong> Sensory stimulation is not the same thing as a true commitment of the will. Be cautious of using your senses to worship worship.</p>

        <h2>Suggestions for the Road</h2>

        <p><strong>SOUND:</strong> "Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth. Sing to the Lord, praise his name" Psalm 96. Use musical instruments – Psalms 147, 149, 150. Read the Scriptures out loud. We often have our hearts and thoughts challenged when we hear the Word of God.</p>

        <p><strong>SMELL:</strong> No incense offering will wipe out a single sin. However, incense isn't used to find favor with God, but to help us pray. It is a means, not an end.</p>

        <p><strong>TOUCH:</strong> Holding a paper clip while you pray could help you focus on a marriage that is falling apart; a rubber band could help you pray for a pliable heart. Carry a nail in your pocket on Good Friday to reaffirm your commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>SIGHT:</strong> Check out the religious art of Rembrandt and others. We may find that looking at someone or a picture of someone while we pray for them increases our ability to pray.</p>

        <p><strong>TASTE:</strong> Taste some salt as you pray for your influence in a non-Christian environment. Jesus says He is the bread of life; remind yourself of this when you taste it.</p>
