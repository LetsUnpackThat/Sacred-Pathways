        <h1>Traditionalist</h1>
        <div class="tagline">Loving God Through Ritual and Symbol</div>

        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Many rightly fear a form of faith that has no substance so they stress, "Christianity is a relationship, not a religion."</li>
            <li>We must remember that God invented and sometimes commanded religious practices.</li>
            <li>Religious practices are the way people embody spiritual truths.</li>
            <li>Abraham and Moses expressed their faith by building altars.</li>
            <li>God understands that our reaction to symbols often reveals our hearts' reaction to him. If we're flippant toward symbols, we're often flippant toward what the symbol represents.</li>
            <li>Peter and John observed regular, set times of prayer.</li>
            <li>Paul willingly underwent the ritual of purification.</li>
            <li>The NT figures made it clear that no one will be saved through religion alone; but they also made it clear, by their example, that Christians can be nourished by certain religious practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Are Our Pitfalls?</h2>

        <p><strong>SERVING GOD WITHOUT KNOWING GOD:</strong> Religion can serve faith, but it doesn't substitute for faith, and it can never replace faith.</p>

        <p><strong>NEGLECTING SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS:</strong> It is not enough for us to cultivate holiness; we must reach out and minister to others. Amos 5:21-24. Jesus says that religion without substance is hypocrisy.</p>

        <p><strong>JUDGING OTHERS:</strong> Religious practice can powerfully enhance a person's faith, but it can also destroy corporate faith if it is used to criticize, measure, or divide. Colossians 2:16-17.</p>

        <p><strong>REPEATING MECHANICALLY:</strong> Without attention ritual becomes an empty exercise that fills us with insincerity.</p>

        <h2>Suggestions for the Road</h2>

        <p><strong>RITUAL:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find a special way to celebrate the religious holidays, i.e. Good Friday, Easter, Christmas, Pentecost. Place a reminder in your calendar.</li>
            <li>Read Scripture aloud.</li>
            <li>People in church history read Psalms 50, 62, 90, 103, & 140 daily or regularly.</li>
            <li>Read something from Pascal on November 23rd the day he had a life-changing experience with God. Read Bonhoeffer on April 9th – the day of his martyrdom. Look up Augustine's birthday and read him that day.</li>
            <li>Develop your own call to worship and repeat it frequently every month. Write and repeat your own prayers.</li>
            <li>Create an intercessory prayer list.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>SYMBOL:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Symbols help us to preserve a "moral memory" to help us live rightly. Some who have failed sexually can begin wearing a cross to remind them to stay pure. Others could wear a ring during certain periods of prayer to remind them to pray.</li>
            <li>Symbols from Christian art that you could place in your home include: anchor [hope]; arrow [martyrdom/pain]; banner [triumph]; circle [eternity]; crown [sovereignty]; lamp [wisdom]; square [earthly existence].</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>SACRIFICE:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fasting during Lent.</li>
            <li>Give up something permanently or dedicate something to the Lord's use.</li>
            <li>Give your money sacrificially.</li>
        </ul>
